            <p>Your first project car can be an exciting — and sometimes intimidating — experience. You want everything to be perfect, and the fear of messing up is real. I've been there. After a lot of trial and error, here's what I've learned: it doesn't need to be perfect.</p>
            <p>Every car has its imperfections, and failure is one of the best teachers. The more you work on cars, the more confident you'll become. Don't be afraid to try new things or make mistakes — just make sure you learn from them.</p>
            <p>That said, there are some things you should avoid as a beginner. That's one of the main reasons I created this page. Be sure to check out the FAQ section above — I guarantee you'll find at least one thing you didn't know before</p>
