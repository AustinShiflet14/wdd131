            What is the best project car to start with?
        </button>
        <div id="answer1" class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Start with a car that is drivable and not a full ground-up restoration. It's best to pick a vehicle that's relatively reliable and doesn't overwhelm you.</p>
